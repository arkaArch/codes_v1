/*
Problem: Factorial Numbers Not Greater Than N.
Your task is to print all the factorial numbers which are less than or equal to ‘n’.

Input: 7
Output: 1 2 6
Since, 1! < 7, 2! < 7 and 3! < 7

Expected time complexity: O(m),
where ‘m’ is the number of factorial numbers which are less than or equal to ‘n’.
