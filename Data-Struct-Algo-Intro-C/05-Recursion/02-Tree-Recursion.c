See the next image to understand flow of the program:

Tracing Tree – There are total 15 function calls here for "tree_recursion(3)"

So, 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 calls (G.P – Geometric Progression series)

We can write the above equation as, 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 2^(3+1) – 1
In general form: 2^0 + 2^1+ 2^2 + … + 2^n = 2^(n+1) – 1.
So, time Complexity of this function is O(2^n). 
Required space(stack is used) is the height of tracing tree, here is 4, i.e O(n)
